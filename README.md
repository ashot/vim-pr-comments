## Installation

### Using Vundle
```vim
Plugin 'ashot/vim-pr-comments'
```

```

### Using Pathogen
```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/ashot/vim-pr-comments
```

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to any file in a Git repo with an open PR
2. Run `:PRCommentsOpen` to load comments
3. Use quickfix window to navigate and interact:
   - `Enter` - Jump to comment location
   - `Space` - View full comment details
   - `r` - Reply to comment
   - `R` - Resolve comment thread
   - `U` - Unresolve comment thread

## Configuration

Add to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
" Maximum comment length in quickfix (default: 300 chars)
let g:pr_comments_max_length = 500

" Show full comments without truncation (default: 0)
let g:pr_comments_show_full = 1

" Enable line wrapping in quickfix window (default: 0)
let g:pr_comments_wrap_quickfix = 1

" Show resolved comments by default (default: 0 - hidden)
let g:pr_comments_show_resolved = 0
```

## Usage

### Commands

#### Primary Commands
- `:PRCommentsOpen` - Open comments (uses cache if available)
- `:PRCommentsReload` - Force refresh from GitHub
- `:PRCommentsAll` - Show all comments including resolved

#### Additional Commands
- `:PRCommentsDebug` - Show debug information
- `:PRCommentDetail` - Show full comment in preview
- `:PRCommentReply` - Reply to selected comment
- `:PRCommentResolve` - Resolve selected thread
- `:PRCommentUnresolve` - Unresolve selected thread

### Default Mappings

#### Global
- `<leader>prc` - Open PR comments (cached)
- `<leader>prr` - Reload PR comments (fresh)
- `<leader>pra` - Show all including resolved
- `]c` / `[c` - Next/previous comment
- `]C` / `[C` - Last/first comment

#### Quickfix Window
- `<CR>` - Jump to location and close quickfix
- `o` - Jump to location (keep quickfix open)
- `<Space>` - Show full comment details
- `r` - Reply to comment
- `R` - Resolve comment thread
- `U` - Unresolve comment thread

## Workflow Example

```vim
:PRCommentsOpen          " Load PR comments
" Navigate with j/k in quickfix
<Space>                  " Read full comment
r                        " Type reply and hit enter
R                        " Mark thread as resolved
:PRCommentsReload        " Refresh after new comments
:PRCommentsAll           " Show resolved comments too
```

## How It Works

1. Detects current Git branch and finds associated PR
2. Fetches comments via GitHub REST API
3. Queries GraphQL for resolution status
4. Populates quickfix with smart line number detection
5. Uses GraphQL mutations for resolve/unresolve
6. Posts replies to the correct review thread

## Comment Resolution

- **Resolved comments hidden by default** - Keeps focus on active discussions
- **View resolved with** `:PRCommentsAll`
- **Resolution state from GitHub** - Not based on comment text
- **Proper thread management** - Resolves entire conversation thread

## Tips

- Comments are cached per session for fast access
- Use `:PRCommentsReload` after new comments are added
- Press `<Space>` in quickfix for full comment with code context
- The plugin shows comment count and resolution status
- Line numbers auto-adjust for file changes since review

## Troubleshooting

### "No PR found for branch"
Ensure your branch has an open PR on GitHub

### "Failed to fetch PR comments"  
Check `gh` CLI authentication:
```bash
gh auth status
gh pr view  # Should show your PR
```

### "Cannot resolve: permission denied"
You need write access to the repository to resolve comments

### Line numbers incorrect
Comments use line numbers from when they were created. If files changed significantly, positions may be approximate.
